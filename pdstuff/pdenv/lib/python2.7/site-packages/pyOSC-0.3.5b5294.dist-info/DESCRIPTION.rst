Simple OpenSoundControl module in Pure Python. Replaces the 'SimpleOSC' module.
  This implementation is intended to still be 'Simple' to the user, but much more complete
  (with OSCServer & OSCClient classes) and much more powerful
  (the OSCMultiClient supports subscriptions & message-filtering,
  OSCMessage & OSCBundle are now proper container-types)
This is a 'Pure Python' implementation, intended to be simple and transparent.
  If you ar looking for a FAST OSC-implementaion, try the 'pyliblo' package
